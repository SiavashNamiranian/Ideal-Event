Title: Ideal-Event

Description: When you search for an event name or a location you get a list of events in upcoming order based on ascending dates from recent to latest. When you click on an event you get those event details alongside with the weather application forecast included or most relevant date provided. We used the ticketmaster API because it is has an abundance of free API information and could add to it using a free weather forecast. We faced the challenge of collaborating in a group and integrating our changes intermittently. We hope to integrate a global weather that is responsive to dates further out from our free API forecast.

How To Use: When you open the webpage you enter a location and/or event name for your search parameters. Then get a list of upcoming events and click on that event and get event details and weather date or most relevant forecast data.
